        <p>Things are changing for good for Android Developers. In Google I/O 2017, the Android team announced that Kotlin was becoming an official language to develop Android apps. This means that, while it is still possible to develop Android apps using
            Java, from now on Kotlin is fully supported, and Google is making sure that every new Android feature, the framework, the IDE and all their libraries work seamlessly with the new language. Google listened to the community, who was asking for
            years that Kotlin became a first-party language. So you can now take advantage of all the features of a modern language while developing for Android. Throughout this book, I will show you how, so I hope that I can help you understand the various
            ways that Kotlin can take you one step ahead and make your code much better. However, before diving into the features of the language, let me tell you just a little bit of background.</p>
